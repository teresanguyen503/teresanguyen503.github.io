                <p>I'm Teresa, a dedicated Computer Science student with a 
                    passion for software development. So far, my journey has
                    given me the opportunity to work on a variety of projects,
                    allowing me to gain valuable experience and skills. While 
                    I have yet to specialize in a specific area, I am eager to 
                    learn and explore different technologies, as I am commited to 
                    continuous learning and growth through my career.
                </p>
                <p>Feel free to browse through my portfolio to see my work in more detail.
                    I look forward to the possibility of working together to create 
                    something amazing.
