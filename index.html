                    continuous learning and growth throughout my career.

                        Key Learning Experience: Led a team for the first time, developing leadership skills by managing project timelines, 
                        delegating tasks, and fostering collaboration among team members. This experience taught me the importance of clear 
                        communication, effective planning, and adaptability in guiding a project. Our team wrote a comprehensive documentation, 
                        including <strong><i><a href="assets/files/installations_and_instructions.pdf" download>installation and usage instructions</a></i></strong>, which reinforced the importance of clear communication and thoroughness
